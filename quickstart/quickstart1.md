# Getting started: First benchmark

<span>1.</span> Download [latest release](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/releases/latest) and unpack it

```
> wget {{ site.last_release.url }}
    && unzip {{ site.last_release.zip }}
    && cd {{ site.last_release.dir }}
```


<span>2.</span> Start Hyperfoil in interactive mode (CLI)

```
> bin/cli.sh
```

<span>3.</span> Run the minimalistic benchmark, doing only single request to `http://hyperfoil.io`:


```
[hyperfoil@localhost]$ run-local examples/single-request.hf.yaml
Running benchmark 'single-request'
Using 1 thread(s)
Target servers: http://hyperfoil.io:80/ (1 connections)
1 requests in 0.24s
                 Avg    Stdev      Max
Latency:      229.11 ms      0 ns 229.64 ms
Requests/sec: 4.166666666666667

```
Doing one request is not much of a benchmark and the statistics above are moot, but hey, this is a quickstart.

Now that you know how to run a benchmark, let's take a deeper look into {% include example_link.md src='single-request.hf.yaml' %}.

{% include codesample.html src='distribution/src/main/resources/examples/single-request.hf.yaml' %}

In the future you might find [editing with schema]({{ "/docs/editor.html" | absolute_url }}) useful but at this point any editor with YAML syntax highlighting will do the job.

Ready? Let's continue with [something a bit more realistic]({{ "/quickstart/quickstart2.html" | absolute_url }})...

{% include quickstart_links.md %}
